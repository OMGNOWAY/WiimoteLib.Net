# WiimoteLib.Net

A modified version of **[WiimoteLib](https://github.com/BrianPeek/WiimoteLib)** to support Audio playback among other things. **Note:** Google searches for WiimoteLib will return a fork of it over the original. Make sure you look for the original by Brian Peek as it is more up to date.

This library is nowhere near a usable or even readable state. Many things are subject to change including the name of this project.

Work on this project began as a program for gamplay without the use of a standard two-hand controller (due to issues with my right hand).

**Important Note:** WiimoteController is currently in *DolphinBar Mode*, in this state, it foregoes Bluetooth connections and looks for the device directly. You will likely need to disable this if you do not own a DolphinBar.
